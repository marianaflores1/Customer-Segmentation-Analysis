# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

This study examines customer data for the purpose of conducting a segmentation analysis to guide personalization strategy. Segmentation analysis is derived in Python by applying an unstructured learning technique called K-Means Clustering with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify and segment customers into three subgroups. Key findings and recommendations are derived through a combination of SQL, Excel, and PowerPoint and both provide context into the analysis as well as executive summary of business insights.

## Business Objective
To maximize the value of customers to the business through a personalization strategy tailored to each segment.

## Summary of Analysis
I.   Import data

II.  Explore data

III. Identify Outliers

IV.  Feature Engineering

V.   Correlation Estimate

VI.  Hierchical Clustering

VI.  K-Means

VII. K-Means with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

VIII. Results


## Key Findings & Recommendations
K-Means is a traditional clustering technique commonly used for segmentation data. Three clusters are identified, due to the number of clusters we run ten iterations using K-Means then combine Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for additional clarity. The following three subgroups are identified from the analysis:

- Segment 1 (37%) - 16.43% Male and 83.56% Female gender, average age of 33.08 years, income of $39.68K, and spending score of 53.32.

- Segment 2 (25%) - 84.00% Male and 16.00% Female gender, average age of 54.62 years (oldest subgroup), income of $53.64K, and spending score of 42.18.

- Segment 3 (37.9%) - 42.66% Male and 57.33% Female gender, average age of 34.16 years, income of $83.45K (highest earning subgroup), and spending score of 52.49.


Based on K-Means Clustering with PCA analysis - recommendations to maximize customers value to the business include: tailoring offerings to each subgroup and incorporating additional data to identify ways to upsell or cross-sell and thus maximize customer's Spending Scores and Lifetime Value.
